== Execution Model

SmallRye Reactive Stream Operators provides a way to control on which thread are the different callbacks invoked. By
default it uses the caller thread.

If you are building a Vert.x application, add the following dependency to your project so enforce the Vert.x execution
model:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-streams-vertx-execution-model</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

With this dependency, if you are calling `ReactiveStreams.x` from a Vert.x thread, the same thread is used to call the
different callbacks and pass the result.
